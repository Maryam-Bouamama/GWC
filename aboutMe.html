<h2 id="Age";>Age:</h2>
<p style =font-family:Quicksand;color:#FFDFD3;> I prefer to go by 12 years old but society claims I'm 16. I say you shouldn't discriminate based off age.</p>
<h2> School:</h2>
<p style =font-family:Quicksand;color:#FFDFD3;>The east side union high school district decided that it was a good idea to impose evergreen valley high upon me and so the legal law of the land and the taxes my parents are forced to pay every year led me to attend this school.
It is driven by a cougar mascot who roars instead of purrs, as is scientifically accurate, and teal and black seem to be its driving force rather than the general well-being of its students' overall education.
(BUT COUGARS DONT ROAR THEY PURR WHAT KIND OF HIGHER EDUCATION IS THIS)</p>

<h2 id="Intro";>Intro:</h2>
<p style =font-family:Quicksand;color:#FFDFD3;>I’m a part of my school’s robotics team, and I am the only person in the programming team other than one other girl.
Everyone else on the team is a male in mechanical, and I have recently become the brunt of their coding jokes.
Our team is called the prototypes, and our logo’s basically a cougar but cooler.~ Our club sweatshirt was one of the greatest intellectual breakthroughs in the history of our club.
I joined my school’s animation club, but dropped out after a year because it was less of an animation club and more of an institution that was only created for the club leaders' academic advantages in their college application.
I am also currently part of GWC’s Summer Immersion Program at Cadence and it is one choice I do not regret, which means something considering all the heavy regrets I hold.</p>

<h2 id= "hobbes">Hobbies:</h2>
<p style ="font-family:Quicksand;color:#FFDFD3;">I enjoy reading a good book, and I draw more than is humanly possible. I also mildly enjoy baking and cooking as long as I'm not being forced to do it by my mother, but I prefer cooking due to the many many desserts I have turned into Maryam originals.
My macchiato macarons are more of a macchiato flataron, if you will, a more exquisite form of the delicate cookie, and swiss rolls have been professionally reformed into swiss collapsed cakes. </p>
<h2 id="skills">Skills:</h2>
<p style =font-family:Quicksand;color:#FFDFD3;> My skills include drawing the most unproportional portraits in mere minutes, reading for hours at a time without breaks, and coming up with unorthodox ideas and theories that follow no pattern of logic and rival the imagination of a 6 year old. Yes, that is a skill.
And yes, that has led me to make cognitive breakthroughs that has recieved high-level recognition. But then again, everything is high-level recognition if you're taller than me.</p>
<button class="btn btn--swap" style= "font-family: Sigmar One;">Because my current height...<span><a href= "https://m.wikihow.com/Grow-Taller"> Is 4'11''</a></span></button>
<h2 id="Food";>Favorite Foods:</h2>
<p style ="font-family:Quicksand;color:#FFDFD3;">I could honestly go on for hours about foods I love, but I’ll shorten it down for the convenience of my sore typing fingers. I love seafood, particularly fish and calamari. No, fish and calamari isn't the only seafood in earth's giant hydroflask, there's also sea urchin for any uncultured individuals looking for enlightenment.
Clam chowder is always queen, no matter what certain Thanos enthusiasts believe, and shrimp is the jewel of the sea, not because I relate to its puny size, but because its taste is...shrimpy, bro.
I love asian food as well, particularly japanese and korean. Tteokbokki is something I could eat everyday, and hotteok is bliss I have only experienced once. If you wish to send me hotteok, please send it to this address: 2854 plzsendfood drive.
Soba, ramen, udon, and basically any other japanese noodles are dear to my heart, and tamagoyaki is delicious because eggs. I also love thai food, but I am unaware of their dish names so I'll just relay tastes through an advanced form of telepathic communication.
 Of course, I could never get tired of my homeland’s food, so moroccan dishes like tajine and bastilla are always favorites. However, I do sense a mounting pressure from my mother to learn to cook moroccan food, and that is why I have been forced to make tajine 8 times now. I'm waiting for it to stop...but I think she's planning on having me go up to 9,000.
WHICH BRINGS ME to an unecessary tangent about my mother's tendency to make me repeat a recipe until I am dehydrated and dream of mixing flour with cheetos to make onion canolli. I once made nothing but banana bread every weekend for six months straight.
It was painful and I'm convinced it has legally made me a survivor of a traumatizing event, but now my family claims my banana bread is the best they've ever eaten.
I'm sure it's just an excuse to get me to make tajine another 60 times. I STILL LOVE FOOD REGARDLESS BECAUSE MY TASTE BUDS ARE PROFESSIONAL ATHLETES AND HAVE WON A 5-STAR IN TASTE OLYMPICS SO TELL GORDON RAMSAY TO TOP THAT</p>

<h2 id="japanoob">Places I want to Travel:</h2>
<p style="font-family:Quicksand;color:#FFDFD3;">I would love to go to korea and japan someday. My friends and I have even planned a trip to japan together, which at first we viewed as a middle schooler rant but is now becoming a genuine goal in our lives. To some people's concern, at the rate it's going, it may even become a greater priority than college. My only worry is how four broke kids are going to pay for it.
We plan on going between high school graduation and college graduation, though part of me is secretly convinced we won't go until we're 80 years old and our neices and nephews wil have to pay for our flight. We'll chill in japan on wheelchairs.</p>
